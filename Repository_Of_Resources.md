## Modelling projections

### [Bed projections: covid19-reqd-beds-projection](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/covid19-reqd-beds-projection) 
#### What the resource does
"Simple script to generate a projection of beds required to support given trajectory of covid19 cases requiring hospitalisation."
Takes inputs on expected hospitalisations and length of stay, to output capacity requirement projections.
#### Who developed the resource
NHS BNSSG Analytics

### [Capacity-dependent death projections: covid-simr](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/covid-simr) 
#### What the resource does
"Simple script to generate a projection of deaths arising from insufficent acute/ICU capacity for a given trajectory of covid19 cases requiring hospitalisation, and to model the effect of various user-defined mitigating scenarios."
#### Who developed the resource
NHS BNSSG Analytics

### [33N COVID ICU capacity model](https://covid.33n.co.uk/login) 
#### What the resource does
A model looking at ICU resource (ventilation, PPE) and workforce planning. Excel and web tools available. 
Discussed in the FutureNHS modelling [huddle](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalyticsCovid19/view?objectID=19407216). Must register with 33N for access. 
#### Who developed the resource
33N

### [LSTHM CCMID Hospital Bed Occupancy Projections](https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/hospital_bed_occupancy_projections/)
#### What the resource does
Webapp to forecast bed occupancy for COVID-19 patients using recent data on admission and an exponential growth model.
You can choose to model critical or non-critical care beds.
#### Who developed the resource
LSTHM CCMID

## Identifying vulnerable groups

### [COVID-19 phenomics](https://covid19-phenomics.org/#section-algorithms)
#### What the resource does
"A comprehensive, open-access resource providing the research community with information, tools and phenotyping algorithms for defining COVID-19 related phenotypes in UK electronic health records data."

## Analytical communities

### [FutureNHS Collaboration Platform](https://future.nhs.uk/)
#### What the resource does
Collaborative platform for those working in health and social care. COVID-19-specific workspaces, including one focused on data and analytics. Offers of support as well as discussion boards. 
#### Who developed the resource
NHS England and Improvement

### [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/)
#### What the resource does
Community of analysts (NHS and beyond), primarily focusing on analytical methods in R. Dedicated COVID-19 channel within their slack workspace. 
#### Who developed the resource
Led by the Improvement Academy & University of Bradford, with support from the Health Foundation, NHS Improvement, NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit & NHS Wales Delivery Unit

### [HDR-UK: COVID-19](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/covid-19/)
#### What the resource does
Working to prioritise health data research that addresses front-line needs  Find out more, including their matchmaker database for sharing experience and expertise via their website. 
#### Who developed the resource
Health Data Research UK; the national institute for health data science
