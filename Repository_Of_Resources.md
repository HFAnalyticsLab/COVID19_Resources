### [Capacity-dependent death projections: covid-simr](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/covid-simr) 
#### What the resource does
"Simple script to generate a projection of deaths arising from insufficent acute/ICU capacity for a given trajectory of covid19 cases requiring hospitalisation, and to model the effect of various user-defined mitigating scenarios."

### [LSHTM CCMID Hospital Bed Occupancy Projections](https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/hospital_bed_occupancy_projections/)
#### What the resource does
Webapp to forecast bed occupancy for COVID-19 patients using recent data on admission and an exponential growth model.
You can choose to model critical or non-critical care beds.

## Identifying vulnerable groups
### [Shielded patient list - NHS Digital methodology](https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/shielded-patient-list/methodology)
#### What the resource does
Documents describing the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria for contracting coronavirus (COVID-19), who should be shielded for at least 12 weeks.

NHS Digital

### [COVID-19 phenomics](https://covid19-phenomics.org/#section-algorithms)
#### What the resource does
"A comprehensive, open-access resource providing the research community with information, tools and phenotyping algorithms for defining COVID-19 related phenotypes in UK electronic health records data."

### [Comorbidity package in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/comorbidity/vignettes/comorbidityscores.html)
#### What the resource does
"`Comorbidity` is an R package for computing comorbidity scores based on ICD codes data. As of version 0.1.0, comorbidity can calculate the Charlson comorbidity score and the Elixhauser comorbidity score, using either the ICD-9 or ICD-10 coding system."
