# Repository of resources to support COVID-19 response analytics
This is a repository collecting together links to practical resources for analysts working to support health and care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Contents
* [Modelling projections](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Repository_Of_Resources.md#modelling-projections)
* [Identifying vulnerable groups](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Repository_Of_Resources.md#identifying-vulnerable-groups)

## Modelling projections

### [Bed projections: covid19-reqd-beds-projection](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/covid19-reqd-beds-projection) 
#### What the resource does
"Simple script to generate a projection of beds required to support given trajectory of covid19 cases requiring hospitalisation."
Takes inputs on expected hospitalisations and length of stay, to output capacity requirement projections.
#### Who developed the resource
NHS BNSSG Analytics

### [Capacity-dependent death projections: covid-simr](https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/covid-simr) 
#### What the resource does
"Simple script to generate a projection of deaths arising from insufficent acute/ICU capacity for a given trajectory of covid19 cases requiring hospitalisation, and to model the effect of various user-defined mitigating scenarios."
#### Who developed the resource
NHS BNSSG Analytics

### [33N COVID ICU capacity model](https://covid.33n.co.uk/login) 
#### What the resource does
A model looking at ICU resource (ventilation, PPE) and workforce planning. Excel and web tools available. 
Discussed in the FutureNHS modelling [huddle](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalyticsCovid19/view?objectID=19407216). Must register with 33N for access. 
#### Who developed the resource
33N

### [LSTHM CCMID Hospital Bed Occupancy Projections](https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/hospital_bed_occupancy_projections/)
#### What the resource does
Webapp to forecast bed occupancy for COVID-19 patients using recent data on admission and an exponential growth model.
You can choose to model critical or non-critical care beds.
#### Who developed the resource
LSTHM CCMID

## Identifying vulnerable groups

### [COVID-19 phenomics](https://covid19-phenomics.org/#section-algorithms)
#### What the resource does
"A comprehensive, open-access resource providing the research community with information, tools and phenotyping algorithms for defining COVID-19 related phenotypes in UK electronic health records data."
