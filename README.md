## COVID-19 resources for analysts 
This repository is a collection of links to practical resources, including tools and code for analysts working to support health and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The repository is organised into:
* [Resources](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Repository_Of_Resources.md)
* [Communities and online events](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Communities_and_Events.md) 

#### Project Status: in progress

## Scope 
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic analysts in the health and care system have to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape of analytical tools and resources. To support them in their work, we prioritise resources that can directly help with planning and decision-making. The primary audience for this collection is analysts working in the public and voluntary sectors across the UK. 

As always, analysts need to consider whether they have the expertise required to the resources listed here in an appropriate way. Inclusion within this repository does not indicate that the Health Foundation endorses the resource, or offers any opinion on its validity or accuracy. While we endeavour to keep this repository up-to-date, please also check that you are accessing the most recent version of any resource - this is particularly important in such a rapidly changing environment.

**Resources must have an online location where updates and documentation can be accessed**  
Analytical resources are updated as more information comes to light and approaches are refined; this means files are likely to go through many iterations. To ensure that analysts can be confident they have access to the most current information regarding a resource, we aim to limit our repository to resources which have a central online location where analysts can check for updates and related documentation. This could be a github repository, an organisational website or a dropbox location. We will not include resources shared via email or posted as standalone files on community platforms. 

If you are uncertain about how to best share your analytical work, you may find our blog outlining [simple ways to make it easier for others to make use of your work](https://towardsdatascience.com/collaboration-in-a-time-of-crisis-9a7f6a61324b) helpful. We also discussed these issues in an NHSE/I mini-huddle - the [recording](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalyticsCovid19/view?objectID=20378704) for this is on the Future NHS platform. 

## Getting involved
We welcome involvement and contributions from the analytical community - your contributions will make the repository as useful as possible.

We encourage suggestions for resources that could be added to the repository. If you come across something that was useful in your own work, or have developed something you would like to share, please let us know. As we try to identify the most relevant resources for the community, it would be helpful to hear from anyone searching for a particular tool or trying to solve a particular problem, even if they haven't managed to find it yet.  

### Contributing using GitHub 
Adding resources via GitHub will require you to have a personal GitHub account. You can [sign up to GitHub for free](https://github.com). You can then either file an issue or fork the repository and submit a pull request. 

#### Filing an issue
If you would like to report a bug in the repository (eg a broken link), or suggest a resource for inclusion, please file an issue. Github has some [guidance](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) on this if it is your first time filing an issue. If you are suggesting a resource for inclusion, please include the link for the resource, a brief summary of what it does (ideally highlighting its practical value) and the name and organisation of the creator. 

#### Pull requests 
We are also more than happy to receive pull requests if you would like to contribute directly - GitHub has some [guidance](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) on this too. We have a [template for submissions](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Template_For_Submissions.md), so please follow this if you wish to suggest a resource for inclusion via a pull request. 

### Contributing by email
