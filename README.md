## Documentation for the repository of resources to support analysts in responding to COVID-19 
This is the documentation for a repository collecting together links to practical resources, including tools and code for analysts working to support health and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

To see the resources we have currently gathered together, please see [Repository_of_Resources.md](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Repository_Of_Resources.md). We also have a list of [analytical communities and online events](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Communities_and_Events.md) that may be useful.

## Scope of the repository
This repository is intended support health and care analysts with resources (including tools and code) that may be helpful in their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. To help analysts navigate the rapidly evolving landscape, we prioritise the inclusion of resources that can directly help with planning and decision-making. Our primary intended audience is analysts working in the public and voluntary sectors, across the UK. 

As always, analysts should also consider whether they have the required expertise to appropriately apply the resources listed here. Inclusion within this repository does not indicate that we endorse the resource, or offer any opinion on its validity or accuracy. Whilst we endeavour to keep this repository up-to-date, please also check that you are accessing the most up-to-date version of any resource - this is particularly important in such a rapidly changing environment. 

## Getting involved
We are encouraging everyone to be involved, your contributions will make the repository as useful as possible.

We welcome suggestions for resources that could be added to the repository, so if you have come across something that was useful, or have developed something you would like to share, please let us know. As we try to identify the most useful tools to include, it would also be really helpful to hear from you if you are searching for a tool to solve a particular problem, but haven't managed to find it yet.  

### Using GitHub to get involved

#### Filing an issue
If you would like to report a bug in the repository (eg a broken link), or suggest a resource for inclusion, please file an issue.

If you are suggesting a resource for inclusion, please include the link for the resource, a brief summary of what it does and the name and organisation of the creator. 

#### Pull requests 
We are also more than happy to receive pull requests if you would like to contribute directly - GitHub has some [guidance](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) on this too. We have a [template for submissions](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/COVID19_Resources/blob/master/Template_For_Submissions.md), so please follow this if you wish to suggest a resource for inclusion via a pull request.
